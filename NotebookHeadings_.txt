DESCRIPTION
To determine & analyze factors behind heart attacks. Also, to develop a model for prediction of heart attack.
SUMMARY
Task # 1
Importing, Understanding, and Inspecting Data

Performing preliminary data inspection and report the findings as the structure of the data, missing values, duplicates, etc.

Based on the findings from above, removal of duplicates & treating missing values using an appropriate strategy, if any.

Getting a preliminary statistical summary of the data. Exploring the measures of central tendencies and the spread of the data overall.

Task # 2
Performing EDA

Identifying the data variables which might be categorical in nature. Describing & exploring these variables using appropriate tools e.g., bar plot.

Studying the occurrence of CVD across different ages.

Can we detect heart attack based on anomalies in resting blood pressure of the patient

Studying the composition of overall patients w.r.t. gender.

Task # 3
Performing EDA

Describing the relationship between cholesterol levels and our target variable.

What can be concluded about the relationship between peak exercising and occurrence of heart attack

Is thalassemia a major cause of CVD

How are the other factors determining the occurrence of CVD

Using a pair plot to understand the relationship between all the given variables.

Performing logistic regression, predicting the outcome for test data, and validating the results by using the confusion matrix.

Task # 4
Dashboarding

Visualising the variables using Tableau to create an understanding for attributes of a Diseased vs a Healthy person.

Demonstrating the variables associated with each other and factors to build a dashboard
